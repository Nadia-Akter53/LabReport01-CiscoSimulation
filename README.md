This repository contains the code and materials for Lab 4, which focuses on incorporating SMTP, FTP, and DNS servers in a networked environment. The objective of this exercise is to set up and configure these essential network services and demonstrate how they interact in real-world networking scenarios.


SMTP is used for email communication, allowing the sending of messages between clients and servers.

FTP enables secure file transfer, allowing users to upload and download files from a remote server.

DNS helps resolve domain names to their respective IP addresses, facilitating easy navigation on the internet.
